    "coverLetter": "Dear Sir/Madam,\n\nI am writing to express my interest in opportunities where I can contribute as a Senior Full-Stack Engineer. With over 8 years of experience delivering scalable SaaS, FinTech, and GovTech solutions, I bring deep technical expertise, proven problem-solving skills, and a strong record of driving measurable business impact.\n\nIn my current role at Termgrid, I designed and scaled a debt management platform handling over 1M records, improved performance by 30%, and reduced deployment times by 40% through automated CI/CD pipelines. Previously at Deloitte, I built real-time enterprise dashboards, cut page load times by 50%, and led a team of developers, fostering collaboration and code quality. My experience at Cognizant and NIC further strengthened my skills in building secure, high-performance systems and reducing infrastructure costs through serverless architectures.\n\nSome of my key strengths include:\n\t‚Ä¢\tExpertise in React, Next.js, Node.js, NestJS, and AWS for building modern, scalable applications.\n\t‚Ä¢\tProven ability to optimize cloud costs (up to 50%) and improve CI/CD pipelines.\n\t‚Ä¢\tExperience delivering cross-platform solutions with React Native and event-driven systems.\n\t‚Ä¢\tStrong collaboration and mentorship skills, working effectively across distributed, multicultural teams.\n\nI am particularly drawn to roles that emphasize scalability, performance, and innovation, where I can leverage my skills in AI/LLM integration, DevOps automation, and cloud-native practices to help organizations grow.\n\nI would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and expertise align with your company‚Äôs needs. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.\n\nSincerely,\nManish Gandotra\nüìû +91-8800463103\nüìß manish.gandotra.eu@gmail.com\nüåê manishgandotra.com\nüîó LinkedIn | GitHub"
